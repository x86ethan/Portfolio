# Portfolio

This is the main repository for my portfolio on the internet. You can find it at my main address: [ethan-robert.xyz](http://ethan-robert.xyz). 

## Why a website like this? 

For two main reasons: 

1. This is almost mandatory in the IT sector to have your own portfolio, where you can expose your projects. This is something the recruiters will be expecting, so having a page (especially when there's only *your* name inside the URL) where you can explain who you are and what you do is the best way to stand out as an IT operator. 

2. As a freelancer, I need visibility for my clients. I need to show who I am to them as well. Having a website that can 'prove' my talent as a web designer/developer is a great idea! This is also a great way to get hired, as everything useful for contacting me can be found on this website!
